## Description

The Note Taker - Express application can be used to write, save, and delete notes. The application uses an express backend and saves/retrieves note data from a JSON file. The application is deployed on Heroku following this [link](). The app uses the following HTML and API:

  * GET `/notes` - Returns the `notes.html` file.
  
  * GET `*` - Returns the `index.html` file.

  * GET `/api/notes` - Reads the `db.json` file and returns all saved notes as JSON.

  * POST `/api/notes` - Receives a new note to save on the request body, adds it to the `db.json` file, and then returns the new note to the client.

  * DELETE `/api/notes/:id` - Receives a query parameter containing the id of a note to delete, removes the note with the given id property, and then rewrites the notes to the `db.json` file.
